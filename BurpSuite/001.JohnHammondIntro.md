- [x] Intercept only requests to specific sites.
- [x] How to Encode & Decode URL bits.

## Setup BurpSuite
1. Launch it and proceed with defaults.
2. Launch the internal browser since it is preconfigured. 
3. We are going to test it out on **dvwa.co.uk**
    - Install **docker**:- 
        ```sh 
          sudo apt install docker.io
          sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
       ```
    - Log out and in of your machine.
    - Google for **dvwa docker**.
    - Run `docker run --rm -it -p 80:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa`.
       > **80:80** -> port on our machine: port on virtual machine to map it to.
     
    - Hit up **127.0.0.1:80**. *:80 is optional since browsers assume it's the port by default.*
    - Login with:
        ```
          User: admin
          Password: password
       ```
      
     - Scroll down and click on **Create â€¦**. Log in to dvwa and it'll be up and running.

4. Switch to **BurpSuite**:
    - Check the option *show only in-scope items* under sitemap.
    - Open *target > scope*.
    - *Include in scope* click on *Add* and paste *http://127.0.0.1*
    - To make sure we only intercept our desired traffic, go to *proxy > options* and tick *And URL Is in target scope* under *Intercept Client Requests*.
    - Now turn on *Intercept* under *Proxy > Intercept* and magic away.
